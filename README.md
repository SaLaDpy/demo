# SpringSaLaDpy Demo

## Description

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks (simulate.ipynb & analysis.ipynb) that demonstrate the simulation, analysis, and visualization capabilities of SpringSaLaDpy. It also contains SpringSaLaD simulations that have already been run.

## Usage

Clone this repository and install the associated package by running the command: pip install springsaladpy. Make sure you already have Python and Jupyter set up in whatever coding environment you plan on using. If you can run the first cell in either notebook, that means everything is setup correctly. If this doesn't work and you get an error relating to importing packages, try creating a new virtual environment and installing the springsaladpy package there.
